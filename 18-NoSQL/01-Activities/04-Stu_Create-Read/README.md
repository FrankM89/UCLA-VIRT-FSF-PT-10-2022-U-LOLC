## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is **atomicity** within the context of databases? Why is it important to understand when performing write operations with MongoDB?

<!-- Atomicity means that multiple operations can be grouped into a single logical entity, that is, other threads of control
 accessing the database will either see all of the changes or none of the changes. -->

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
